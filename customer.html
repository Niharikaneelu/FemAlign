        What is Customer Profiling
    </h2>
    <p>
        Customer profiling is the process of creating detailed descriptions of an organization's ideal customers, encompassing their demographics, behaviors, needs,</br>
        and motivations. It helps businesses understand their target audience better, enabling them to tailor marketing and sales efforts to resonate with the right 
        people and improve customer experience.
