 <h1>Company Description</h1>
 <p>FemAlign is a technology-driven wellness innovation focused on enhancing 
workplace health and overall work productivity and economic growth 
through smart user-friendly solutions. Our product, the Smart Chair, is 
designed to address back pain, stress, dehydration, and irregular sleep 
patterns, which significantly impact efficiency in the IT industry.

 The idea for our Smart Chair emerged from a deep understanding of the 
health challenges faced by IT professionals. As students and aspiring 
engineers, we observed a common issue—prolonged sitting leading to back 
pain, dehydration, stress, and poor sleep patterns. This problem not only 
a ected individual well-being but also had a significant impact on work 
e ciency and overall productivity in the IT industry.
 
During research and surveys, we discovered that:
 @ 80% of IT employees experience posture-related discomfort.
 @ Many workers forget to stay hydrated.
 @ Prolonged sitting and stress contribute to irregular sleeping habit.

 Eventually these factors a ect workplace performance and economic 
growth.
 
By realizing the lack of an all-in-one solution, we planned to create a smart 
chair that could actively help users maintain better posture, stay hydrated, 
and improve workplace wellness.
 We started by defining our problem statement along with ideation and 
research, analyzing existing solutions.
 Then we refined our problem statement by collecting suggestions from 
stakeholders, we focused on integrating posture correction, hydration 
tracking, and comfort adjustments into a smart chair.</p>
