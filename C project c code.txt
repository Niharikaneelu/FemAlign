This C code uses Emscripten’s EM_JS macro to directly insert JavaScript into the webpage. It dynamically creates a <style> element containing CSS for a moving gradient background. When the WebAssembly module runs, it automatically applies this animated background to the entire page. This approach improves the visual experience without needing separate JavaScript files.


Code 

#include <emscripten.h>

EM_JS(void, applyGradientBackground, (), {
    const style = document.createElement("style");
    style.innerHTML = `
        body {
            margin: 0;
            height: 100vh;
            background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #ee7752, #e73c7e, #23a6d5, #23d5ab);
            background-size: 400% 400%;
            animation: gradientMove 15s ease infinite;
        }

        @keyframes gradientMove {
            0% {background-position: 0% 50%;}
            50% {background-position: 100% 50%;}
            100% {background-position: 0% 50%;}
        }
    `;
    document.head.appendChild(style);
});

int main() {
    applyGradientBackground();
    return 0;
}

This C code generates a dynamic HTML page displaying frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Smart Chair project. Using simple printf statements, it outputs HTML content including headings, questions, and answers. It follows the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) format by printing the required Content-type: text/html header at the beginning. This method allows integration of C programs with web servers to deliver real-time webpage content dynamically.

Code

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Content-type: text/html\n\n");
    printf("<html><head><title>Smart Chair - FAQs</title></head><body>");
    printf("<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>");


    printf("<h3>Q1: What is the Smart Chair?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: The Smart Chair is an ergonomic, sensor-equipped chair designed to improve posture, reduce stress, and monitor wellness in real time—especially for IT professionals and remote workers.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q2: Who can use the Smart Chair?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: It’s ideal for people working long hours at a desk, such as software engineers, office staff, freelancers, and even students.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q3: What features does it have?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: The chair includes posture correction sensors, hydration reminders, stress detection, sleep pattern analysis, and AI-driven health recommendations.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q4: How does it detect stress?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: It uses biometric sensors like heart rate and posture sensors to analyze body language and stress indicators in real time.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q5: Is any app required to use the Smart Chair?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: Yes, we provide a companion mobile/web app that syncs with the chair to show health stats, analytics, and personalized suggestions.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q6: Can companies monitor employee health?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: Yes. With employee consent, companies can access anonymized health data to improve workplace wellness and productivity.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q7: Is the chair customizable?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: Yes, the Smart Chair adapts to different body types and user preferences using adjustable ergonomics and AI models.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q8: Does it need to be plugged in all the time?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: No, it includes a rechargeable battery system that lasts for several days on a single charge.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q9: Is my data safe?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: Absolutely. All data is encrypted and stored securely. We follow strict data privacy policies and GDPR standards.</p>");

    printf("<h3>Q10: When will it be available for purchase?</h3>");
    printf("<p>A: We are currently in the prototype stage and plan to launch commercially within the next 6–12 months.</p>");

    printf("</body></html>");
